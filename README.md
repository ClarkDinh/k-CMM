# k-CMM Algorithm
- This project is based upon work supported in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research/Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development (AAFOSR/AOARD) under award number FA2386-17-1-4046.
- This proposes an algorithm named k-CMM for Clustering Mixed Numerical and Categorical Data with Missing Values
- Comments are very welcome and can be sent to email: taidinh@jaist.ac.jp, it08duytai@gmail.com
- The code is implemented in Python 3.6. If you use this code, please cite to the following paper with Bib:
